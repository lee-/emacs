;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  With the hi-lock commands text matching interactively entered
;;  regexp's can be highlighted.  For example, `M-x highlight-regexp
;;  RET clearly RET RET' will highlight all occurrences of `clearly'
;;  using a yellow background face.  New occurrences of `clearly' will
;;  be highlighted as they are typed.  `M-x unhighlight-regexp RET'
;;  will remove the highlighting.  Any existing face can be used for
;;  highlighting and a set of appropriate faces is provided.  The
;;  regexps can be written into the current buffer in a form that will
;;  be recognized the next time the corresponding file is read (when
;;  file patterns is turned on).
;;
;;  Applications:
;;
;;    In program source code highlight a variable to quickly see all
;;    places it is modified or referenced:
;;    M-x highlight-regexp RET ground_contact_switches_closed RET RET
;;
;;    In a shell or other buffer that is showing lots of program
;;    output, highlight the parts of the output you're interested in:
;;    M-x highlight-regexp RET Total execution time [0-9]+ RET hi-blue-b RET
;;
;;    In buffers displaying tables, highlight the lines you're interested in:
;;    M-x highlight-lines-matching-regexp RET January 2000 RET hi-black-b RET
;;
;;    When writing text, highlight personal cliches.  This can be
;;    amusing.
;;    M-x highlight-phrase RET as can be seen RET RET
;;
;;  Setup:
;;
;;    Put the following code in your init file.  This turns on
;;    hi-lock mode and adds a "Regexp Highlighting" entry
;;    to the edit menu.
;;
;;    (global-hi-lock-mode 1)
;;
;;    To enable the use of patterns found in files (presumably placed
;;    there by hi-lock) include the following in your init file:
;;
;;    (setq hi-lock-file-patterns-policy 'ask)
;;
;;    If you get tired of being asked each time a file is loaded replace
;;    `ask' with a function that returns t if patterns should be read.
;;
;;    You might also want to bind the hi-lock commands to more
;;    finger-friendly sequences:

;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-z\C-h" 'highlight-lines-matching-regexp)
;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-zi" 'hi-lock-find-patterns)
;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-zh" 'highlight-regexp)
;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-zp" 'highlight-phrase)
;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-zr" 'unhighlight-regexp)
;;    (define-key hi-lock-map "\C-zb" 'hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns))

;;    See the documentation for hi-lock-mode `C-h f hi-lock-mode' for
;;    additional instructions.

;; Sample file patterns:

; Hi-lock: (("^;;; .*" (0 (quote hi-black-hb) t)))

(define-minor-mode hi-lock-mode
  "Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Hi Lock mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the
highlighting commands listed below, such as \\[highlight-regexp].
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.

In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the
highlighting will not be updated as you type.

When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a \"Regexp Highlighting\" submenu
is added to the \"Edit\" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:

\\[highlight-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-phrase] PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)

\\[highlight-lines-matching-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-symbol-at-point]
  Highlight the symbol found near point without prompting, using the next
  available face automatically.

\\[unhighlight-regexp] REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.

\\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the \\[hi-lock-find-patterns] command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with \\[hi-lock-find-patterns],
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is
  'ask and the user responds y to the prompt, or if
  `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that
  function returns t.

\\[hi-lock-find-patterns]
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by \\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]).

When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the
form:
  Hi-lock: FOO

where FOO is a list of patterns.  The patterns must start before
position \(number of characters into buffer)
`hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns will be read until
Hi-lock: end is found.  A mode is excluded if it's in the list
`hi-lock-exclude-modes'.

\\[hi-lock-revert-patterns-file-name]
  Search the current buffer for the variable
  `hi-lock-patterns-file' and set it (to a potentially new value)
  even when this variable is already set.

This variable is used to specify a file in which to store
highlighting-patterns.  This allows you to keep the patterns in a
separate file which can be shared among multiple files.  This is
particularly useful when editing source code because you can use
a single file with highlighting-patterns which is shared by
multiple files of the same project.

When using a separate file, highlighting-patterns can still be
written to the current buffer with
\\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns].  Both the patterns from
the current buffer and from the separate file apply.

The file with the highlighting-patterns is transparently
maintained in a dedicated buffer.  The dedicated buffer is
automatically saved to `hi-lock-patterns-file' when the current
buffer is saved.

You can specify `hi-lock-patterns-file' as a buffer-local
variable.  Please note that the value of this variable (the file
name) must be given in double-quotes.

Please see also `hi-lock-file-name-specifier'.

\\[hi-lock-constant]
  Highlight the thing at point with the `hi-constant' face.

\\[hi-lock-functionlike]
  Highlight the thing at point with the `hi-functionlike' face.

\\[hi-lock-global-variable]
  Highlight the thing at point with the `hi-global' face.

\\[hi-lock-revert-patterns-from-file]
  Revert the currently used highlighting-patterns to the patterns
  in `hi-lock-patterns-file'.

\\[hi-lock-revert-patterns-file-name]
  Once `hi-lock-patterns-file' has been set, the current buffer
  is not searched again for a line specifying this variable.  You
  can revert to the value specified in the current buffer with
  \\[hi-lock-revert-patterns-file-name].  This is for instances
  when you modified the value of the variable and want the new
  value take effect."
