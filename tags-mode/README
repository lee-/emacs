tags-mode:

	Automatically insert and update tags in files --- currently
	supported tags are TAG:LAST-MODIFIED and TAG:FILENAME.

	self documenting (M-x describe-mode, or see source)

	More tags can be added with some programming.  If I need
	support for more tags,	I`ll think about implementing some
	sort of customisation so they can be added without changing
	the code.

	To install:

		M-x byte-compile-file tags-mode.el
		(load "tags-mode")  ;; in your ~/.emacs

	En/disable the mode with M-x tags-mode. You can have a line in
	your files specifying the mode, see first line of this file.

	There is no TAG:CREATED since it doesn`t need to be updated
	automatically. Just do M-x
	tags-insert-file-name-with-last-modified, copy and edit.

	There are no key bindings with this mode.  The idea is that
	you enable the mode and M-x
	tags-insert-file-name-with-last-modified once to get the tags
	inserted, and that`s all.  Of course, feel free to make key
	bindings.
